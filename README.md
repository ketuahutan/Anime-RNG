# Anime-RNG
Its a simple Anime RNG filled with 100 characters that you can roll with a click of a button
# Why did i make this?
Its literally made out of an acident, i was learning python and trying the randint and i figured i want to make it to a webpage with a button, that doesnt work out. So, i use a little bit of javascript to do the random number thing and this Anime RNG is born. Ultimately, Im bored.
